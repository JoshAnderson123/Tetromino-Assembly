# Tetromino-Assembly
Optimisation project in Design Engineering MEng. #3 best optimiser in the cohort.
Brief: Create an algorithm that can place a set of tetromino (tetris) pieces to match a target board, maximising accuracy and minimising speed.
The target board size can range from 10x10 to 1000x1000.
This project developed skills in optimisation, combinatorics, Big O analysis, recursion, and data structures.
