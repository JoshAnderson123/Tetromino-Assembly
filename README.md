# Tetromino Assembly
Optimisation project in Design Engineering MEng.
<br><br>
**Brief**: Create an algorithm that can place a set of tetromino (tetris) pieces to match a target board, maximising accuracy and minimising speed.
The target board size can range from 10x10 to 1000x1000.
<br><br>
**Skills developed**: Optimisation, combinatorics, Big O analysis, recursion, and data structures.
<br><br>
**Result**: Created a greedy optimisation algorithm that used binary trees and recursion. Running time of O(n). This optimiser was the #3 best optimiser in the cohort.

**Files included**
1. main.py - contains optimiser code
2. resources.py - contains resources for main.py
